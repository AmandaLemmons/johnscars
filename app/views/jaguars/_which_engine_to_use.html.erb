      Stock small block motors provide considerable improvements over Jag power. Use a 305 (5.0) for fuel economy or a 350 (5.7) for more punch. Other V8 sizes, 327, 400 (small block) etc. are also suitable. I am definitely pro Hot Rod but I don’t want you to get the idea that you need a high performance motor to motivate that Kitty (the OEM 6 and 12 are 4.2 and 5.3L respectively).

      <strong>Fuel Injection (FI):</strong> For years we’ve suggested carb motors to keep it simple, however, GM has the bugs worked out and we are ready when you are. Four OEM systems are available, throttle body injection (TBI) that uses a carb looking unit with two centrally located injectors, tuned port injection (TPI) with an injector at each port, the high revving LT-1, and the completely new Vortec V8 motor. All of these FI systems work great with a JCI Conversion Kit.

        FI is not a cheap date, but you’ll have class provided you don’t try to shortcut the job. A JCI Conversion Kit includes the special radiator hoses, throttle linkages and supporting instructions for a FI motor but DOES NOT include the Fuel Injection harness, ECM, fuel pump or associated wiring and plumbing that is FI related. You must buy a custom harness (or modify an original harness) from the aftermarket FI guys. There are many businesses that sell tech manuals, complete harnesses, ECMs, filters and FI related hardware, here are two we use:

          The headers for this conversion were not CARB approved.  However, in January 1998 sanity prevailed and the emission laws changed, and now imply that all cars 25 or more years old are exempt from emissions standards.  This would mean pre-1974 TR7's would be eligible to use our headers - please check with your local authorities!
