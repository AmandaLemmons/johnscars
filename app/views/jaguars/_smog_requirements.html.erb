    <p>Emission equipment – not just for LA anymore. All the needed equipment – catalytic converter(s), air pump, preheated air cleaner assembly, PCV and EGR valves, heat riser or EFE, vapor canister, etc – will fit when using my V8 kit.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Check with your local authorities or inspection facilities to determine what is required for your conversion. Usually, the newest factor (engine or car) determines what year standards you will have to meet, but again, check with the local authorities. Sometimes they will insist on a FI V8 if your Jag had fuel injection, and others won't let you use a truck motor in a passenger car. If they waffle, have them put it in writing!</p>
    <p><strong>California:</strong> Call 800-952-5210 for official literature. As we understand the laws, cars manufactured in 1973 or earlier are exempt from emissions (a 30 year rolling exemption law begins 2004 [1974]). All newer V8 Fuel Injection conversions must have a VSS and an ALDL port for the smog test. Note: If you're installing a V8 into a Jaguar with an electric speedo, you will need JCI's VSS Buffer. (BONUS: it eliminates the flaky Lucas speedo transducer). JCI Headers are not CARB approved – you must use GM exhaust.</p>
