        Please fill out the three ZCar Conversion Kit Order Sheets completely, <strong>sign them</strong>, and return them with a <strong>money order or cashier's check</strong>.

      </p>
      <p>
        The order sheets are JPEG images (about 185K each) so it will take a minute or so to load.   Print it out from a Laser, LED or ink-jet printer only – dot matrix printer will be useless.  Make sure your print margins are set to .50 inches or it may not fit on a page.

            <td colspan=4> <strong><small>6</small></strong>	I strongly suggest the polyurethane suspension bushing set. Designed for rally cars, they absolutely stop rear axle steer and don’t ruin the ride! Two front and eight rear bushings are supplied. A must for TR8s too. Put the front bushings in before installing the V6 as you’ll have the bolts out for the mounts. Rear bushings can be done anytime.</td>
