Salvation for the anemic TR7.  A John’s Cars conversion will provide you with the oomph you deserve (more than a "TR8") and saves your Triumph from being on the way to the lonely boneyard.  Don’t feel as if British Leyland built the only four-cylinder Titanic, GM had the Vega.  Unfortunately your V6 TR7 will be shunned by its leaky, overheating ex-stablemates and you’ll lose favor with "friends" who will always be wanting to try out your toy.  The V6 TR7 defines performance, especially when you match up with a TR8 – just don’t take all his money – but dependability is what this swap is really all about, performance is a side effect!
