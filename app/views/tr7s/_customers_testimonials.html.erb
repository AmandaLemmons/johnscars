        Enclosed are photos of our TR7 with the Buick 231 everything is complete and runs very well. The swap was rather easy and all parts we needed were in the kit. The power is unreal compared to the original engine. Feel free to give my name to any people that ask about your kit; I am very satisfied with it..... Larry Mizelle, Temperance, MI.

        I agree with you. Price is secondary if you can get quality, service and knowledge!!! (TR7 & XJ6)..... Mike Bancerowski, Fayetteville, AR.

        I have been impressed with the completeness of the kit. As I told you, I tend to spend quite a bit of armchair time planning before I turn a wrench. (TR7)..... Lonny Wall, Edmond, OK.
